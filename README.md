# React + Vite Project

This is a React project bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ehtesham1234/proveway_task-manager-app-frontend.git

## Navigate to the project directory:

 ```bash
 cd proveway_task-manager-app-frontend


## Install the dependencies:

 ```bash
 npm install

## Running the Project Locally
Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

The app will be running at http://localhost:5173 by default.


## Ensure the backend server is also running:

## The project interacts with a backend API. You need to run the backend server locally or set the API base URL in your environment variables.

## If running the backend locally, ensure it is running at http://localhost:5000.

## Otherwise, set the backend API URL by creating a .env file in the root of your project and adding the following variable:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=<your-backend-url>
By default, the app will look for the backend API at http://localhost:5000
